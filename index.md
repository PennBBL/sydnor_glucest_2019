# GluCEST IMAGING OF REWARD RESPONSIVENESS
<br>
*Glutamate-modulating psychotropics such as ketamine have recently been found effective for treating anhedonia, motivating interest in parsing relationships between glutamate and reward functioning. Moreover, rodent and non-human primate studies have demonstrated that antagonism of AMPA and group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors decreases reward sensitivity, whereas optogenetic activation of reward network glutamatergic afferents is reinforcing. However, despite convergent evidence from clinical and preclinical studies suggesting that glutamate availability may modulate reward responsiveness, validation of such a relationship in humans has been difficult, given limitations in our ability to study glutamate in the human brain. In this project, we therefore capitalize on a novel, ultra-high field imaging method GluCEST (Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer), which offers enhanced sensitivity, spatial coverage, and spatial resolution for imaging glutamate in vivo. Specifically, this project capitalizes on GluCEST data collected at 7T from a transdiagnostic population (healthy, depression, psychosis-spectrum) to test the hypothesis that lower levels of glutamate within the brain's reward network are dimensionally associated with diminished reward responsiveness. Given that diminished reward responsiveness is linked to poor psychological wellbeing, psychiatric disorder risk, suicidal ideation, and psychotropic treatment resistance, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this clinical phenotype is vitally important.*
